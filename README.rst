OARS plugin for `Tutor <https://docs.tutor.overhang.io>`__
===================================================================================

This plugin controls the configuration of several different other Tutor plugins
to join them into the Open edx "Open Analytics Reference System", a way for Open
edX installs to collect and display learner data in a consistent way.

This plugin will house the configuration and allow for various overrides, however
it currently does nothing.
